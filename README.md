# LabWork - TRSPO
 
This program is designed to generate, process, and analyze two-dimensional points in space. It allows you to work with two sets of points that can be randomly generated or loaded from a file. The main goal of the program is to determine the location of the points relative to a line passing through their extreme values, and to determine whether it is possible to separate the two sets of points by this line.
